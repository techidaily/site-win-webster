It used to be that when I select a line then hit the tab key the line would be moved over based on the tab.  
 Now the line gets replaced by the tab.  
 I do not have “replace tabs with space” setting turned on.  
 Because of this I can no longer select multiple lines and tab them.  
 What happened

 It should work. You will have to select multiple lines. If you select a single line or a portion of a line, the selection will be only replaced by a tab.

 I did select multiple lines and it still does not work. I know it used to work.  
 So I installed EMeditor on another computer and the tab worked. Then I exportedimported my settings from the one that does not work into the new one and it also stopped working.

 Would you please email me at [tech@emurasoft.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/) with the exported settings after zipped? I will try to reproduce your issue. Thank you.

 I received your email. Thanks!  
 I imported your settings, and I reproduced your issue. The issue was somehow your TAB was not assigned to “Indent” command any more. Please go to configuration properties, Keyboard tab, select “Edit” category and “Indent” command, press TAB in the text box and click “Assign” button. This will resolve the issue. I will try to reproduce your other issue about restore workspace shortly.

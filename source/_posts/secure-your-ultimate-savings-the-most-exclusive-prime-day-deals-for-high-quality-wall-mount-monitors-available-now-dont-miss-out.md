## FAQs

### When was Amazon Prime Day 2024? 

[Prime Day](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-prime-day-2024-everything-you-need-to-know/) is one of the most popular sales events of the year. In 2024, Amazon's Prime Day [ran](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-prime-day-2024-everything-you-need-to-know/) from July 16 at 12:01 a.m. PDT through July 17\. The annual two-day sale provides discounts on technology, electronics, home products, clothing, and more.

### Are monitors really cheaper on Prime Day? 

In our experience, monitors often get excellent discounts during the two-day Prime Day sales event. Vendors including Samsung, LG, and Sony are only a handful among many that cut the price of their monitors by up to 30% or 40%, making Prime Day a great opportunity to upgrade your existing hardware.

### How do I know which monitor is right for me? 

As a valuable tool for work, productivity, and entertainment, picking the right monitor as part of your home setup is imperative. If you have a smaller space, consider going for a display size within the 20- to 30-inch range, while larger spaces could more readily accommodate sizes between 30 and 50 inches. We recommend flat screens (and preferably with eye comfort technologies) for work, but gamers are better served by curved screens and a higher refresh rate, as they provide a more immersive experience. If you plan to use your monitor to watch movies, however, consider products with 4K resolution.

### How did we choose these Prime Day deals?

At ZDNET, we only write about deals our team members would want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. We looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.

We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we recommend. These recommendations may also be based on our testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
